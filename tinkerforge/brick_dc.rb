    # in mV.

    # This callback is triggered if either the current consumption
    # is too high (above 5A) or the temperature of the driver chip is too high
    # (above 175Â°C). These two possibilities are essentially the same, since the
    # temperature will reach this threshold immediately if the motor consumes too
    # much current. In case of a voltage below 3.3V (external or stack) this
    # callback is triggered as well.
    # 
    # If this callback is triggered, the driver chip gets disabled at the same time.
    # That means, BrickDC#enable has to be called to drive the motor again.
    # 
    # .. note::
    #  This callback only works in Drive/Brake mode (see BrickDC#set_drive_mode). In
    #  Drive/Coast mode it is unfortunately impossible to reliably read the
    #  overcurrent/overtemperature signal from the driver chip.

    # If a velocity of 0 is present, acceleration is set to 5000 and velocity
    # to 10000, CALLBACK_VELOCITY_REACHED will be triggered after about 2 seconds, when
    # the set velocity is actually reached.
    # 
    # .. note::
    #  Since we can't get any feedback from the DC motor, this only works if the
    #  acceleration (see BrickDC#set_acceleration) is set smaller or equal to the
    #  maximum acceleration of the motor. Otherwise the motor will lag behind the
